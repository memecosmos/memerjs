### Important points to consider when running or editing these tests:

- These tests are not re-runnable for the same local node's instance.
- Every test file should use its own test addresses to avoid errors. Jest will run test files in parallel.
- Mnemonics from the .env file are used to add genesis accounts, which are used in tests
